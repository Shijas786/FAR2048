# 🎉 FAR2048 Local Setup - Status

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **✅ Node.js Version Verified**: v22.16.0 (Perfect!)
2. **✅ All Dependencies Installed**:
   - Frontend: 957 packages installed
   - Backend: 1053 packages installed  
   - Contracts: 1598 packages installed
3. **✅ Concurrently Installed**: For running multiple servers
4. **✅ Environment Files Created**:
   - `frontend/.env.local` with backend URL
   - `backend/.env` with basic config
5. **✅ Servers Started** (in background):
   - Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: Running on http://localhost:3001

## 🚀 What's Running

Your FAR2048 app is now starting! The servers are initializing in the background.

## 📱 How to Access

**Open your browser and go to:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the FAR2048 lobby!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the app doesn't load immediately:

### 1. Check Server Status

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
# Check if Next.js is running
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Check if backend is running  
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
```

### 2. View Server Logs

The servers are running in background terminals. To see their output:
- Look for terminal windows that opened
- Or run them manually to see logs:

**Terminal 1 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Common Issues

**Issue: Port already in use**
```bash
# Kill processes on ports
npx kill-port 3000 3001
```

**Issue: Module not found**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm run setup
```

**Issue: Backend won't start (missing Supabase)**
This is OK for now! The backend will start with warnings but the frontend will still work in "demo mode" without full database features.

## 🎮 What You Can Do Now

Even without full setup, you can:

1. **View the UI**: See the beautiful lobby, game interface
2. **Test Game Logic**: The 2048 game works client-side
3. **Explore Components**: Browse through the codebase

## 📋 Optional: Full Setup

For complete functionality (database, real multiplayer):

### 1. Supabase Setup (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create new project (free tier)
3. Copy `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
5. Enable Realtime for `matches` and `match_players` tables
6. Get credentials from Settings > API
7. Add to `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
   ```
8. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
   ```

### 2. Privy Setup (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://privy.io
2. Create app (free tier)
3. Add to `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

### 3. Restart Servers

After adding env variables:
```bash
# Stop current servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)
# Or kill ports:
npx kill-port 3000 3001

# Restart
npm run dev
```
