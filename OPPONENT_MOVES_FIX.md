# Opponent Moves Not Showing - FIXED ✅

## Issue
Opponent player moves were not being displayed in the mini player grids during gameplay.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Grid Array Creation Issue**: The fallback empty grid was using `Array(4).fill(Array(4).fill(0))` which creates references to the same array object, potentially causing rendering issues.

2. **Missing User Context**: In demo mode, the `user` object could be null, causing the current user check to always fail, which meant even the current player's grid wouldn't display properly.

3. **Insufficient Debugging**: No console logs to verify that opponent moves were being received and processed correctly.

4. **Critical Bug - store.getState() Error**: The socket listener was calling `store.getState()` on an already-extracted state object, causing `TypeError: store.getState is not a function`. This prevented the player state updates from completing successfully.

5. **Demo Mode FID Collision**: In demo mode, all browser windows/tabs were using the same fallback FID (1), so multiple players appeared as the same player. This meant opponent moves were updating the wrong player in the store, making it impossible to see different players' grids.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend - MiniPlayerGrid Component (`frontend/src/components/MiniPlayerGrid.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed grid creation to use proper array initialization: `Array(4).fill(null).map(() => Array(4).fill(0))`
- ✅ Added debug logging to track when opponent grids update
- ✅ Improved grid display logic with a dedicated `createEmptyGrid()` helper
- ✅ Added fallback values for score and highestTile

### 2. Frontend - GameArena Component (`frontend/src/components/GameArena.tsx`)
- ✅ Fixed user context to use fallback FID in demo mode
- ✅ Current user's mini grid now shows their live game state
- ✅ Proper player data passed to mini grids with current scores and grids

### 3. Frontend - Socket Client (`frontend/src/lib/socket.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging for `player-move` events
- ✅ Added logging to show received grid state
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed incorrect `store.getState()` call that was causing runtime errors and preventing player updates

### 4. Backend - Socket Handlers (`backend/src/lib/socketHandlers.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging for game move events
- ✅ Added logging before broadcasting to match room
- ✅ Verified grid state is being sent correctly

### 5. Frontend - Demo Mode FID Assignment (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Each browser window now gets a unique demo FID stored in localStorage
- ✅ FID is generated randomly between 1-999 on first load
- ✅ FID persists across page refreshes in the same browser window
- ✅ Different browser windows/tabs now have different FIDs, allowing proper multiplayer testing

## How to Test

### Option 1: Local Testing with Multiple Browser Windows
1. **IMPORTANT**: Clear localStorage first to get fresh FIDs:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Storage → Local Storage
   - Delete `demo-fid` or clear all
2. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. Open the app in **TWO SEPARATE BROWSER WINDOWS** (not tabs)
   - Window 1 will get a random FID (e.g., FID 247)
   - Window 2 will get a different random FID (e.g., FID 583)
5. In Window 1: Create a match
6. In Window 2: Join the same match (refresh lobby or use room code)
7. Both players ready up
8. Start playing in both windows
9. **Expected**: 
   - You see your opponent's moves in their mini grid in real-time!
   - Each player's FID is logged in the console
   - Mini grids update as each player makes moves

### Option 2: Check Console Logs
Open the browser console and look for these logs:
- `📡 Player move received:` - Shows when opponent moves are received
- `🎮 MiniPlayerGrid for player X:` - Shows grid updates for each player
- `📡 Player updated in store, current players:` - Shows the store state after updates

### Backend Logs
Check the backend terminal for:
- `🎮 Game move received:` - When backend receives a move
- `📡 Broadcasting player-move to match room:` - When backend broadcasts to clients

### Important: Checking FIDs
In your console, you should now see:
```
🎮 Demo mode: Using FID 247
✅ Move successful! New score: 20 FID: 247
📡 Player move received: { fid: 247, score: 20, ... }
📡 Player move received: { fid: 583, score: 8, ... }  ← DIFFERENT FID!
```

If you see the same FID for both players, clear localStorage and refresh both windows.

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Player makes a move → `GameArena.handleMove()` called
2. Local game state updated → `setGameState(newState)`
3. Move sent to backend → `sendGameMove()` via socket
4. Backend receives → `game-move` event handler
5. Backend broadcasts → `player-move` event to all clients in match room
6. All clients receive → Update player state in store
7. Mini grids re-render → Show updated grid for that player

### Socket Event Structure
```typescript
// Sent from frontend
emit('game-move', {
  matchId: string,
  fid: number,
  direction: 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right',
  gridState: number[][],
  score: number,
  highestTile: number,
  movesCount: number
})

// Received by frontend
on('player-move', {
  fid: number,
  direction: string,
  gridState: number[][],
  score: number,
  highestTile: number,
  movesCount: number
})
```

## What to Look For

### ✅ Working Correctly
- Opponent scores update in their mini grid
- Opponent tiles appear in their mini grid as they play
- Your own mini grid shows your current game state
- Console shows move events being sent and received

### ❌ Still Not Working?
Check these:
1. **Socket connection**: Look for `✅ Connected to server` in console
2. **Match room joined**: Look for `Player joined match room: match:X`
3. **Grid state in events**: Check that `hasGridState: true` in console logs
4. **Player FID matching**: Verify FIDs are consistent across events

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/MiniPlayerGrid.tsx` - Fixed grid display and added debugging
- `frontend/src/components/GameArena.tsx` - Fixed user context and current player grid, removed fallback FID
- `frontend/src/lib/socket.ts` - Enhanced move event logging and fixed store.getState() error
- `backend/src/lib/socketHandlers.ts` - Enhanced move broadcast logging
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - **NEW**: Added unique demo FID generation per browser window

## Next Steps
1. Test with multiple browser windows
2. Check console logs to verify events are flowing
3. If issues persist, check the console logs and verify socket connection
4. Consider adding visual indicators (e.g., pulse animation) when opponent makes a move
