## 🔧 **What I Built**

- ✅ `/api/matches/join-by-code` endpoint
- ✅ `/api/matches/:id/approve` endpoint
- ✅ Free play support (0 USDC wager)
- ✅ Player approval tracking
- ✅ Auto-start when all players approve

### Frontend (React/Next.js):
- ✅ **CreateMatchModal** - New free play toggle
- ✅ **JoinByCodeModal** - Enter room codes
- ✅ **Lobby** - "Join with Code" button
- ✅ **MatchCard** - Show room codes & copy button
- ✅ API functions for join-by-code & approve

### Database:
- ✅ Added `room_code` to matches table
- ✅ Added `requires_approval` flag
- ✅ Added `has_approved` to match_players
- ✅ Migration SQL script ready (`supabase/migrations/`)
