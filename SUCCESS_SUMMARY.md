## 📝 **ABOUT THOSE BROWSER ERRORS:**

All those errors are **HARMLESS browser extension conflicts**:

### Ignore These:
- ❌ `Cannot redefine property: ethereum` - Wallet extensions fighting
- ❌ `MetaMask encountered an error` - Extension conflict
- ❌ `Unchecked runtime.lastError` - Browser extension noise
- ❌ `ChunkLoadError` - Next.js hot reload (auto-recovers)
- ❌ Missing favicon - Cosmetic only

### What Actually Matters:
- ✅ Backend API calls working (see terminal: `GET /api/matches {}`)
- ✅ Frontend compiling successfully
- ✅ Servers responding
- ✅ Features functional

## 💡 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### Free Play Match:
```
Host creates room → Free Play ON → Generates code ABC-123
    ↓
Friends use "Join with Code" → Enter ABC-123
    ↓
Game starts immediately! (No approval needed)
```

### Paid Match:
```
Host creates room → Free Play OFF → Sets 10 USDC → Code XYZ-789
    ↓
Friends join via code XYZ-789
    ↓
Everyone sees "💰 10 USDC" and "⚠️ Approval Required"
    ↓
Players click "Approve" (backend ready, UI coming)
    ↓
Game starts when all approve!
```
